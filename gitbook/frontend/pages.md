# Pages

The application is split into a few high level pages under `client/src/pages`:

- **Login** and **Signup** – authentication forms.
- **Dashboard** – main area once logged in. Shows bounties or organization info depending on role.
- **Profile** – edit contributor or organization profile.
- **Wallet** – view wallet balance and send tokens.
