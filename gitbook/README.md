# Introduction

![WELCOME](.gitbook/assets/introduction.png)

Hey there! I’m **Kartik Mehta**, the creator of **The DAO Tool** — and I’m genuinely excited to have you here.

This guide is designed to help you get the most out of the platform, whether you’re:

* Setting up your local environment.
* Integrating GitHub or Discord.
* Exploring the project architecture.
* Customising your own DAO workflows.
* Using the REST API to extend the platform.

The DAO Tool is open-source, modular, and built with love for async, decentralised teams. Whether you're running a DAO, an open-source project, or just experimenting — **this doc is your map**.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please stick around, explore the sections, and don’t hesitate to fork, build, and contribute.
{% endhint %}

I'm available if you'd like to chat or discuss anything. Feel free to reach out via [X](https://x.com/kartik_mehta8) or schedule a time on [Calendly](https://calendly.com/kartikmehta/15min).

Thanks for checking it out — and seriously, welcome aboard.
