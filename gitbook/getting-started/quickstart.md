# Quickstart

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/quickstart.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>QUICKSTART</p></figcaption></figure>

You’ve just discovered a fully open-source, developer-friendly, wallet-native DAO coordination tool — and if that sentence didn’t excite you, just wait until you see it run.

This quickstart isn’t here to lecture you — it’s here to get you building (or breaking things) as quickly as possible. Whether you're curious, nosy, or ready to fork this entire repo and launch your own contributor-powered empire, you’re in the right place.

## Try the Hosted Version First

Before you start fiddling with local configs and `npm install`, why not try the real thing?

[**Go to app.thedaotool.com**](https://app.thedaotool.com)

The hosted version is always up-to-date with the latest features and a guided flow that will walk you through the platform like a kind-but-firm onboarding bot.

Test it. Click around. Break something (just not production, please).

## Star the GitHub Repository

Like what you're seeing? Toss us a star — it costs you nothing and helps others discover the project:

[**Star https://github.com/kartikmehta8/thedaotool**](https://github.com/kartikmehta8/thedaotool)

**Bonus:** Stargazers get good karma and slightly better local dev speeds. Probably.

## Ready to Build? Let’s Set It Up Locally.

Okay, jokes aside — if you’re serious about running this project locally, customizing it, or contributing, the next part is all yours.
