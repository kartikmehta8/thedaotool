# Quickstart

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/quickstart.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>QUICKSTART</p></figcaption></figure>

You’ve just discovered a fully open-source, developer-friendly, wallet-native DAO coordination tool — and if that sentence didn’t excite you, just wait until you see it run.

This quickstart isn’t here to lecture you — it’s here to get you building (or breaking things) as quickly as possible. Whether you're curious, nosy, or ready to fork this entire repo and launch your own contributor-powered empire, you’re in the right place.

## Try the Hosted Version First

Before you start fiddling with local configs and `npm install`, why not try the real thing?

👉 [**Go to app.thedaotool.com »**](https://app.thedaotool.com)

The hosted version is always up-to-date with the latest features and a guided flow that will walk you through the platform like a kind-but-firm onboarding bot.

Test it. Click around. Break something (just not production, please).

## Join the Community

Got questions? Found a bug? Have an existential thought about contributor payouts?

Join our builders' Telegram group and hang out with other curious humans:
👉 [t.me/thedaotool »](https://t.me/thedaotool)

We’re friendly. Probably.

## Star the GitHub Repository

Like what you're seeing? Toss us a star — it costs you nothing and helps others discover the project:

👉 [github.com/kartikmehta8/thedaotool »](https://github.com/kartikmehta8/thedaotool)

Bonus: Stargazers get good karma and slightly better local dev speeds. Probably.

## Ready to Build? Let’s Set It Up Locally.

Okay, jokes aside — if you’re serious about running this project locally, customizing it, or contributing, the next part is all yours.
